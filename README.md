##  Projects Overview

## 1.  Rule-Based Chatbot

A simple ChatGPT-style chatbot that responds to user queries using pre-defined rules and keyword matching. Itâ€™s ideal for use cases like FAQ systems, customer support bots, or information assistants.

**Tech Stack:**  
- Python  
- Rule-based logic (if-else, keyword dictionaries)  

**Highlights:**  
- Intent-based response system  
- Customizable for different domains  
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly

## 2. Tic-Tac-Toe AI
A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game powered by an AI opponent. The AI uses smart logic or the MiniMax algorithm to never lose. Play against the computer in a fun and educational experience.

**Tech Stack:**  
- Python  
- MiniMax algorithm (for unbeatable AI)  

**Highlights:**  
- Turn-based interaction  
- Strategic decision-making  
- Great for learning game theory & AI logic

## 3. Recommendation System
A personalized recommendation system that suggests items (like movies or products) using collaborative or content-based filtering. Built using real-world datasets and simple ML models.

**Tech Stack:**  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Cosine Similarity, KNN, or Matrix Factorization

**Highlights:**  
- User-User and Item-Item similarity  
- Clean and interpretable code  
- Can be extended to any domain (e.g., books, shopping, music)
